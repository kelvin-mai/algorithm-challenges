## Multiply All But Self

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i. Solve it without using division and in O(n) time.

### Test Cases

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

- [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] => [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]
- [3, 2, 1] => [2, 3, 6]
